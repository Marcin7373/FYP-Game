# FYP Exploring learning AI
## Abstract
AI is an underutilized aspect of game development in creating dynamic obstacles in fighting games. The projects goal is to use AI in an interesting way that creates a new and interesting player experience. The game is a 2D game where you face a boss that learns every time its beaten. The player needs to find new ways to beat or outsmart the boss as it learns and adapts to the way the player beats it. 

The main part of the project will involve creating a complex AI for the boss which will find a counter to the players way of beating it. The core game loop will involve the player having to beat the AI a certain number of times making it progressively harder each time. The player will die many times to the boss as they learn the enemies moves and patterns with new ones being introduced every time the boss is beaten. Meaning the AI will need to be versatile enough to counter anything the player can come up with.

The project will also have a complex animation system. Because the game takes place in real time the player character movement needs to be responsive to feel good to play. While the boss attacks need to be well telegraphed so that the player knows how to react and what the boss is doing to plan accordingly.

The game will be evaluated by letting many different types of people play it to gauge and adjust the difficulty and to fix any bugs and exploits that might break the game. And making them play it multiple times to see how engaging it is to replay it.


## Plan
Research:
- Research different types of AI and choose which fits the game best.
- Learn basics of a few different game engines to see which is best.
- Choose animation type and start making animations for testing in implementation.

Implementation:
- Create the player character in the game engine using test animations.
- Start creating the AI for the boss.
- Make assets, refining animations, background and boss test animations.
- Test the feel of the basic movements with players.
- Test AI iteratively as it's made

Refinement:
- Refine and finish AI by testing it with players.
- Adjust and finish animations after play testing.
- Test it further with many players adjusting difficulty.
